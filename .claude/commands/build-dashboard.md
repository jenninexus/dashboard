# /build-dashboard — scaffold & customize a dashboard

Set up a polished, self-contained dashboard for the user from a **profile**, then help them
fill it in. Works in this repo (the dashboard seed kit). Agent-agnostic — the heavy lifting is
a zero-dep Node script; you orchestrate + customize.

## How to invoke

```
/build-dashboard [profile] [name] [domain]
```
e.g. `/build-dashboard seo "Acme Studio" acme.com`

## Steps

1. **Pick the profile.** If the user didn't say, list options:
   ```bash
   node scripts/build-dashboard.mjs --list
   ```
   `seo` + `finances` are ready (full dashboard.html); `health` is a planned stub (offer to build out if asked).

2. **Scaffold** (never hand-build the files — run the script):
   ```bash
   node scripts/build-dashboard.mjs --profile <id> --name "<Name>" --domain <domain>
   ```
   This creates `my-dashboard/` with `dashboard.html`, `themes/`, and a stamped `data.json`.

3. **Help fill the data.** Open `my-dashboard/data.json` — every field has a `_comment`. If the
   user gives you their numbers (GA4 screenshot, Search Console export, etc.), write them in.
   Leave unknowns at their example values or `null`.

4. **Theme (optional).** Default is Plasma Green. Available presets: `plasma-green`,
   `aurora-borealis` (turquoise/purple/pink holographic), `midnight-blue`. To reskin, copy a
   `themes/*.css` `:root` block into the `<style>` at the top of `my-dashboard/dashboard.html`
   (see `themes/README.md`). For holographic shimmer, also include `themes/aurora-borealis.effects.css`.

   **Theme tokens are kit-derived — don't hand-edit colors.** They sync from the shared theme
   kits (see `themes/SOURCES.md`):
   - **www-theme-kit** (`tokens/dashboard-palettes.json`) = standalone-HTML dashboards (this seed) + PHP/Bootstrap sites + `/seo`.
   - **syna-theme-kit** (`palettes/syna-palettes.json`) = React / Dockview / Synagen theme-customizer.
   - Add/edit a palette in the kit, then `node scripts/sync-themes.mjs <key>` to regenerate the theme CSS.
   - `node scripts/sync-themes.mjs --list` shows all available source palettes.

   **Spacing & type tokens (don't hand-author cramped px).** Colors are palettes; spacing/type
   live in the upstream theme kit (`www-theme-kit/tokens/dashboard-tokens.css` — private dev kit;
   see `themes/SOURCES.md`). The canonical names: `--dash-space-1..10` (4px scale),
   `--dash-fs-2xs..stat` + `--dash-leading-*` (type), radii, and reusable
   `.dash-card`/`.dash-stat`/`.dash-holdings`/`.dash-ticker` classes — all already inlined into the
   seed's `:root`. Build with these tokens so the dashboard never looks squished, and use the
   canonical font stack (Outfit / Orbitron / JetBrains Mono).

5. **Open it:** `start my-dashboard/dashboard.html` (Windows) / `open` (mac) / `xdg-open` (linux).

6. **Verify** it renders (charts populate, no console errors). If you can screenshot, do so.

## Customizing what's tracked

- **Add a metric** → add the field to `data.json` (with a `_comment`) + reference it in `dashboard.html`.
- **Add a chart** → `<canvas id="x">` in a `.chart-container` + `new Chart(...)` in the script block.
- **Add a section** → copy a card block, new id, wire its data.
- **New domain** → copy `profiles/seo` → `profiles/<new>`, edit `profile.json` + `example-data.json`.

## Building out a planned profile (e.g. health)

The `health` stub in `profiles/health/` lists the sections + which reusable components to port
(progress bars, gauges, foldouts, chips) — `seo` + `finances` are already full examples to model
on. Generalize them — never copy personal data. Then flip `profile.json` → `"status": "ready"` and
add a row to `profiles/README.md`.

## Rules

- The dashboard must stay **self-contained** (works over `file://`, no required server).
- Keep secrets out of tracked files — `.env` only (gitignored).
- Don't edit `themes/seo-tokens.css` Tier-1 brand colors (canonical vendor values).
- User output (`my-dashboard/`) is gitignored — that's the user's, not the seed.
